// POINT BREAKDOWN:
// Simultanious Two-Player mode (30)
// Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (10)
// Implement a new timing/scoring mechanism that adds time to the clock for successful hits (20)
// Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (20)
// Create and implement a new weapon (w/ new behavior and graphics) (Missile with unique flight speed, acceleration and AOE Damage) (20)
// Rocket acclerates throughout flight rather then staying at static speed (?)
// Ships speed up with each kill (?)
